Steps & Learning Process
Setting Up the Project
Created an Images folder and stored multiple images (e.g., image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc.).
Used preload() to load images before the sketch starts.
Displaying Random Images
Stored images in an array (imgs[]).
Used random(imgs) in setup() to select an image dynamically.
Adding a Simple Frame
Used rect() with strokeWeight() and stroke() to create a visual border.
Challenges & Solutions
Image Loading Errors: Ensured images were in the correct directory (Images/).
Undefined Image Variables: Checked if images were correctly assigned in preload().
Scaling Issues: Used width and height parameters in image() to control display size.
